# Red Team Project Compliance

## Motivation

Security compliance is, for some users, unavoidable. Legal regulatory requirements like [FISMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Information_Security_Management_Act_of_2002), which mandate the use of risk management frameworks like [NIST RMF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management_framework) or DoDRMF, can add non-trivial cost and risk to any project.

The impact of compliance on a system's overall security posture is positive. However, for compliance-encumbered projects, simply complying with regulatory requirements should be considered necessary-but-insufficient from an infosec perspective.

Further, the infosec community as a whole could benefit from a more effective feedback loop between security compliance (passive) and offensive security practices like penetration testing (active).

In this light, the [Red Team Project](https://redteamproject.org) will be helping to document and automate compliance tasks in order to:

* **Reduce** the time and risk burden to projects by automating compliance with tools like [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) and our [800-53](https://github.com/redteam-project/compliant) role
* **Accelerate** the A&A process by providing template bodies of evidence (BoE) for open source projects
* **Pentest** security-compliant configurations to help actively identify gaps and provide constructive feedback to regulators
* **Build community** with infosec practitioners and encourage them to take a more active role in making security compliance more relevant and effective
